## 1.1: Graphs and Graphing Utilities

1. The rectangular coordinate system consists of a horizontal number line, the x-axis, and a vertical number line, the y-axis, intersecting at their zero points, the origin. Each point in the system corresponds to an ordered pair of real numbers (x, y). The ﬁrst number in the pair is the x-coordinate; the second number is the y-coordinate. See Figure 1.1 on page 142.

2. An ordered pair is a solution of an equation in two variables if replacing the variables by the corresponding coordinates results in a true statement. The ordered pair is said to satisfy the equation. The graph of the equation is the set of all points whose coordinates satisfy the equation. One method for graphing an equation is to plot ordered-pair solutions and connect them with a smooth curve or line. 

3. An x-intercept of a graph is the x-coordinate of a point where the graph intersects the x-axis. The y-coordinate corresponding to an x-intercept is always zero. A y-intercept of a graph is the y-coordinate of a point where the graph intersects the y-axis. The x-coordinate corresponding to a y-intercept is always zero. 

## 1.1 Basics of Functions and Their Graphs

1. A relation is any set of ordered pairs. The set of ﬁrst components is the domain of the relation and the set of second components is the range. 
2. A function is a correspondence from a ﬁrst set, called the domain, to a second set, called the range, such that each element in the domain corresponds to exactly one element in the range. If any element in a relation’s domain corresponds to more than one element in the range, the relation is not a function. 
3. Functions are usually given in terms of equations involving x and y, in which x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. If an equation is solved for y and more than one value of y can be obtained for a given x, then the equation does not deﬁne y as a function of x. If an equation deﬁnes a function, the value of the function at x, f(x), often replaces y. 
4. The graph of a function is the graph of its ordered pairs. Ex. 5, p. 161 
5. The vertical line test for functions: If any vertical line intersects a graph in more than one point, the graph does not deﬁne y as a function of x. 
6. The graph of a function can be used to determine the function’s domain and its range. To ﬁnd the domain, look for all the inputs on the x-axis that correspond to points on the graph. To ﬁnd the range, look for all the outputs on the y-axis that correspond to points on the graph. 
7. The zeros of a function, f, are the values of x for which f(x) = 0. At the real zeros, the graph of f has x-intercepts. The graph of a function can have more than one x-intercept but at most one y-intercept.
